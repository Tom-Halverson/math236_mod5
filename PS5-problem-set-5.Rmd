The Problem Set covers sections 4.4, 4.5, 3.1, 5.1 


## A Tale of Two Bases


I recommend using R on this problem. Consider the subspace $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^5$ below.
$$
S = \textsf{span}\left(
\begin{bmatrix}
 1  \\
 1  \\
 1  \\
 1  \\
 2  \\
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
1  \\
2  \\
3  \\
0  \\
-1 \\
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
0  \\
0  \\
0 \\
1  \\
 2  \\
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
 -1  \\
 1  \\
 3  \\
 0  \\
 -2  \\
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
1 \\
 0 \\
  1 \\
 3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\right)
$$

a. Give a basis of $S$ consisting of some or all of the vectors used to define $S$ above. 

b. Give a basis of $S$ that has the nice standard basis property (i.e., the 0s and 1s property).

c. For the two vectors below, decide if they are in $S$. If the vector is in $S$ then give its coordinates in each of your bases from part (b). If you can do one of these "by hand" then explain how.
$$
\mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ 11 \\ 14 \\ 7 \\ 11 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad 
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \\ 3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

## Dimension

Find the dimension of the subspace $Z$ of $\mathbb{R}^5$ of *zero-sum* vectors below
$$
Z = \left\{
\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4 \\ x_5 \end{bmatrix}
\ \Bigg\vert\ \  x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 0\ 
\right\}.
$$


## Determinant Properties

Turn in an R-markdown file with your solution to this problem. You can compute determinants in R using the `det` command. Here you will explore some properties of determinants.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
(A = rbind(c(3, 0, -1, 1, 2), c(1, 1, -1, 1, 1), c(-2, -3, -2, 3, 1), c(1, 3, 1, 3, 0),
c(1, 3, 0, -2, 0)))
```

a. Compute the determinant of $A$.
b. Compute the determinant of $A^2$. How does it compare to $det(A)$?
c. Compute the determinant of $A^{-1}$. How does it compare to $det(A)$?
d. Swap two rows of $A$ and then compute the determinant of $A$. 
e. Multiply the 4th row of $A$ by 7 and then compute the determinant. How does it compare to $det(A)$?
f. Compute the determinant of $7A$. How does it compare to $det(A)$?
g. Let $B$ be the matrix below, and compute $det(B)$, $det(A B)$, and $det(A) det(B)$.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
(B = rbind(c(1, 2,1, 1, 1), c(1, 2, 0, 1, -1), c(-2, -1, -2,0, 1), c(1, 0, 1, 3, 0),
c(1, 0, 0, 1,1)))
```

## Matrix Rank

Fill in the entries of the table  with **T** = true or **F** = false or **I** = not enough information to know. (Hint: draw a "picture" of the RREF of $\mathsf{A}$ in each case).  

<style>

    columns: 2 200px;         /* number of columns and width in pixels*/

## A Tetrahedral Basis

In practice, we change bases because problems are computationally easier in another coordinate system or because we learn something by looking at a problem from the point of view of a different coordinate system. The following example illustrates this with ideas that arises both in chemistry and computer graphics. Below is the tetrahedral molecule methane, $\mathsf{CH}_4$. Its coordinates can be described in 3-dimensional space by the vectors below.

$$
\mathsf{C}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
\mathsf{H}_1=\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \frac{3}{2\sqrt{6}} \end{bmatrix},
\mathsf{H}_2=\begin{bmatrix}
 -\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{3}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \\ -\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{6}}
\end{bmatrix},
\mathsf{H}_3=\begin{bmatrix}
 -\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{3}} \\ \frac{1}{2} \\ -\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{6}} 
 \end{bmatrix},
\mathsf{H}_4=\begin{bmatrix}
 \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\0 \\-\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{6}}
 \end{bmatrix}
$$

![](images/ps5-methane.png){width=35%}

Let $\mathcal{M} = \{ \mathsf{H}_1, \mathsf{H}_2, \mathsf{H_3} \}$. Then $\mathcal{M}$ is a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$, which we will call the **tetrahedral basis.** You can see from the plot that these vectors are linearly independent (not all on the same plane)

a. Express $\mathsf{H}_4$ in the tetrahedral basis. Hint: first compute $\mathsf{H}_1+\mathsf{H}_2+\mathsf{H}_3+\mathsf{H}_4$ using the coordinates above. You do not need to do any row reductions for this question.

b. Give the change of basis matrix $T$ that converts from the tetrahderal basis $\mathcal{M}$ to the standard basis $\mathcal{S}$ and compute its inverse that converts from the standard basis back to $\mathcal{M}$.

c. Chemists are interested in symmetry operations. These are linear transformations such that the atom looks the same after the transformation as it did before. For example one such operation is rotation $r_4$ by 120$^o$ around the  $\mathsf{H}_4$ axis. This rotation sends $\mathsf{H}_1$ to $\mathsf{H}_3$, $\mathsf{H}_3$ to $\mathsf{H}_2$, and $\mathsf{H}_2$ to $\mathsf{H}_1$. Give the matrix of $r_4$  in the $\mathcal{M}$ basis.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
r4.M = cbind(c(0,0,0),c(0,0,0),c(0,0,0))
rownames(r4.M) <- c("H1","H2","H3")
colnames(r4.M) <- c("H1","H2","H3")
r4.M
```

d. It is a pain to describe these transformations in the standard basis, but it is easy and elegant to do so in the methane basis. We can now use the change-of-basis matrix to get the matrix in the standard basis. Compute the rotation in the standard basis by multiplying out these matrices in R. Use your matrices from parts b and c.

e. Give the matrix in the $\mathcal{M}$-basis for the following symmetry transformations: (ii) The rotation $r_2$ around the $\mathsf{H}_2$ axis sending $\mathsf{H}_1$ to $\mathsf{H}_3$, $\mathsf{H}_3$ to $\mathsf{H}_4$, and $\mathsf{H}_4$ to $\mathsf{H}_1$. (iii) The reflection $\sigma_{1,2}$  across the plane containing $\mathsf{H}_1, \mathsf{H}_2,$ and $\mathsf{C}$.You do not need to give these in standard coordinates.




## Homogeneous Coordinates

Here is a nature scene with a bird and a palm tree.




```{r,bird1,fig.height=5,fig.width=5, echo=TRUE}
bird = rbind(c(20, 21.3, 23.3, 21.6, 20.7, 21.7, 20.9, 20.3, 18.9, 18.1, 18.3, 19.6, 19.2, 19.1, 19.2, 19.4, 20), 
             c(20, 21.7, 20.9, 21.1, 19.3, 18.7, 18, 18.9, 18, 15.4, 18.6, 19.6, 20, 20.2, 20.3, 20.3, 20), 
             c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1))
fronds = rbind(c(10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 2.5, 4, 6, 9, 10, 10, 9, 7, 5, 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 10.5, 12, 12.5, 12.5, 10, 10, 13, 15, 15.5, 15.5, 14, 12, 10, 10, 12, 14, 14, 13.5, 13, 12, 10),
               c(16, 16, 16, 15, 11, 15, 17, 17.5, 17, 16, 16, 17.5, 19, 19.5, 18.5, 20, 20.5, 20, 19, 16, 16, 18, 20, 20.5, 20, 19, 18, 16, 16, 17, 16, 15, 13.5, 15, 16, 16, 16, 15, 13, 11, 9, 11, 13, 16),
               c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1))
trunk = rbind(c(10, 9, 8, 7.5, 7.5, 8, 10, 8, 6.5, 6, 5, 5, 6, 7, 10),
              c(16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 5, 2.5, 2, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 16),
              c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1))
# intialize the plot
plot(bird[1,],bird[2,],type="n",xlim=c(0,25),ylim=c(0,25),xlab="x",ylab="y")
abline(h=0:25, v=0:25, col="gray", lty="dotted")
# plot the bird, trunk and fronds
polygon(bird[1,], bird[2,], col = "gray", border = "blue")
polygon(fronds[1,], fronds[2,], col = "orange", border = "black")
polygon(trunk[1,], trunk[2,], col = "brown", border = "black")
```


<!-- ![](images/ps4-scene1.png){width=60%} -->

However, I've decided that I want to make some changes.

* I want to **rotate the bird** by  $-\pi/2$ around the point  $(20,20)$ where its head meets its wing.
* I want to **enlarge the fronds** (leaves) of the  plam tree to be bigger by $25\%$.
* I like the trunk just as it is (no changes!), so the fronds should still meet at the point $(10,16)$.
* I want to change  the colors to make it happier. 

For example, here is what I want it to look like (though maybe there is a better color choice).

![](images/ps4-scene2.png){width=60%}

However, I'm not sure how to do this because:

* I only know how to rotate vectors around the point $(0,0)$. So how can I rotate around the point $(20,20)$?
* Likewise, I only know how to expand vectors from the point $(0,0)$. So how can I expand outward from the point $(10,16)$?

I heard someone say that translations via homogeneous coordinates will help to solve my problem. But I'm not sure what to do. Help!

Please submit:

* The numerical $3 \times 3$ matrix `birdmap` that you used for the bird, and an explanation of how you made it.
* The numerical $3 \times 3$ matrix `leafmap` that you used for the leaves, and an explanation of how you made it.
* Your resulting plot where you use happier [colors of your choice](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) that are **unique to you** and express your personal style. (An artist statement is optional.)


For your convenience, here is some template code for you. Once you fill in the proper transformation, this code  will make the final picture. Currently, it updates the colors, but  doesn't change  the bird or the fronds (because it is using the identity transformation).



```{r,bird2,fig.height=5,fig.width=5, echo=TRUE}
#####################
######## update this code with the appropriate linear transformations
birdmap = cbind(c(1,0,0),c(0,1,0),c(0,0,1))
leafmap = cbind(c(1,0,0),c(0,1,0),c(0,0,1))
#####################
######## you do not need to change this the code below this line
newbird = birdmap %*% bird
newfronds = leafmap %*% fronds
# initialize the plot
plot(newbird[1,],newbird[2,],type="n",xlim=c(0,25),ylim=c(0,25),xlab="x",ylab="y")
abline(h=0:25, v=0:25, col="gray", lty="dotted")
polygon(newbird[1,], newbird[2,], col = "cyan", border = "blue")
polygon(newfronds[1,], newfronds[2,], col = "green", border = "black")
polygon(trunk[1,], trunk[2,], col = "brown", border = "black")
```


Finally, here is some R code that might be helpful. It overlays the original and the new version, so that you can directly compare them. Here is what the final comparison should look like:

![](images/ps4-scene3.png){width=60%}



```{r,bird3,fig.height=5,fig.width=5, echo=TRUE}
# initialize the plot
plot(newbird[1,],newbird[2,],type="n",xlim=c(0,25),ylim=c(0,25),xlab="x",ylab="y")
abline(h=0:25, v=0:25, col="gray", lty="dotted")
# plot the new bird and new fronds
polygon(newbird[1,], newbird[2,], col = "gray", border = "blue")
polygon(newfronds[1,], newfronds[2,], col = "orange", border = "black")
# plot the original bird, fronds  and trunk
polygon(bird[1,], bird[2,], col = "cyan", border = "blue")
polygon(fronds[1,], fronds[2,], col = "green", border = "black")
polygon(trunk[1,], trunk[2,], col = "brown", border = "black")
```



**Remark:** This truly is how computer animation works! We use different effects for each object, and need to use homogeneous coordinates to get our desired results.
