# Week 7-8 Learning Goals


Here are the knowledge and skills you should master by the end of the seventh and eighth weeks.


## Orthogonality and SVD


I should be able to do the following **tasks**:

* Find the length of a vector
* Find the distance between two vectors
* Normalize a vector
* Find the cosine of the angle between two vectors
* Find the orthogonal projection of one vector onto another
* Find the orthogonal projection of one vector onto a subspace (using an orthogonal basis)
* Find the orthogonal complement of a subspace
* Find the least squares approximation for an inconsistent system
* Formulate a curve fitting problem as an inconsistent linear system $A \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{b}$
* Orthogonally diagonalize a symmetric matrix as $A=PDP^{\top}$.
* Find the spectral decomposition $A = \lambda_1 \mathsf{v}_1 \mathsf{v}_1^{\top} + 
\lambda_2 \mathsf{v}_2 \mathsf{v}_2^{\top} + \cdots + \lambda_n \mathsf{v}_n \mathsf{v}_n^{\top}$ of a symmetric matrix $A$
* Use an orthogonal diagonalization to find the best rank $k$ approximation of symmetric matrix $A$

## Vocabulary

I should know and be able to use and explain the following **terms** or **properties**. 


* dot product of two vectors $\mathsf{v} \cdot \mathsf{w} = \mathsf{v}^{\top} \mathsf{w}$  (aka scalar product, inner product)
* length (magnitude) of a vector
* angle between vectors
* normalize
* unit vector
* orthogonal vectors
* orthogonal complement of a subspace
* orthogonal projection
* orthogonal basis
* orthonormal basis
* normal equations for a least squares approximation
* least squares solution
* residual vector
* symmetric matrix
* orthogonally diagonalizable
* outer product of two vectors $\mathsf{v} \, \mathsf{w}^{\top}$
* spectral decomposition of a symmetric matrix

## Conceptual Thinking

I should understand and be able to explain the following **concepts**:

* The dot product gives an algebraic encoding of the geometry (lengths and angles) of $\mathbb{R}^n$
* If two vectors are orthogonal, then they are perpendicular, or one of them is the zero vector
* An orthogonal projection is a linear transformation
* The row space of a matrix is orthogonal to its nullspace
* The inverse of orthogonal matrix $A$ is the transpose $A^{\top}$
* Cosine similarity is a useful way to compare vectors, especially in high-dimensional vector spaces.
* The residual vector measures the quality of fit of a least squares solution
* The outer product $\mathsf{v}\,  \mathsf{w}^{\top}$ is a square matrix with rank 1
