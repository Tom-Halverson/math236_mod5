#### Enter the matrix A
We have to load the pracma package in order to get `rref`.
```{r}
require(pracma)
```

Here is the matrix A for this problem.
```{r}
A = cbind(c(12,-7,9,-4,8),c(10,-6,9,-3,7),c(-6,4,-9,-1,-5),c(8,-5,9,0,6),c(4,-7,9,-8,1),c(-18,16,-27,9,-12))
A
```
#### (a) Linear Dependence

Show that the columns of A are linearly dependent by finding two different dependency relations among them. You can write your answer a form  like 5 a1+ 4 a2 + 3 a3 + 2 a4 + a5 = 0, where a1, a2, etc are the columns of A. 

```{r}

```



#### (b) Ax = b

Augment A with b and show that A x = b is consistent and has infinitely many solutions.

```{r}

```


#### (c) Remove the redundancies

Remove the free-variable columns from A to get a new, smaller matrix A'. Show that A' x = b has a unique solution and say what that solution is.

```{r}

```
