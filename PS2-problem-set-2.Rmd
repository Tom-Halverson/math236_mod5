* Due: Tuesday June 1 by 11:59PM CST. 
* Upload your solutions to Moodle in a PDF. 
* Please feel free to **use RStudio for all row reductions.**
* In problems where you use RStudio for row reduction and are not asked to turn in an R markdown file, you can write something like this:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

The Problem Set covers sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.7.

## Parametric Vector Form


Here is the augmented matrix for a system of linear equations $\mathsf{A} \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{b}$, and its RREF.
Give the general solution to this  system in  **parametric vector form** and describe the geometry of the solution. For example, you answer should be something like: "it is a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$" or "it is a line in $\mathbb{R}^7$" or "it is a point in $\mathbb{R}^4$."
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{ccccc|c}
 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 2 & 1 \\
 1 & 0 & -2 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
 -2 & 1 & 5 & 1 & -6 & 2 \\
 -3 & 0 & 6 & 2 & -8 & 1 \\
 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & -3 & 6 \\
 1 & 0 & -2 & -1 & 3 & -1 \\
\end{array}
\right] \longrightarrow \left[
\begin{array}{ccccc|c}
 1 & 0 & -2 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\
 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & 2 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 2 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$


## RREF for a linear system

Here is the reduced row echelon form of a matrix $\mathsf{A}$ (you are not given the matrix $\mathsf{A}$).
$$
\mathsf{A} \longrightarrow \left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
 1 & -2 & 0 & 4 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & -5 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

  a. Give the general solution to this  system in  **parametric vector form** and describe the geometry of the solution. For example, you answer should be something like: "it is a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$" or "it is a line in $\mathbb{R}^7$" or "it is a point in $\mathbb{R}^4$."
  
  c.  Suppose that we also know that $\mathsf{A}\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 1 \\ -3 \\ 2 \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 22 \\ -13 \\ 7 \\ \end{bmatrix}$. Then give the general solution to 
$\mathsf{A} \mathsf{x}= \begin{bmatrix} 22 \\ -13\\ 7 \\ \end{bmatrix}$ in parametric form.






## RREF for a set of vectors

Suppose that we have five vectors 
$\mathsf{v}_1, \mathsf{v}_2,\mathsf{v}_3,\mathsf{v}_4,\mathsf{v}_5$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and that the matrix $A$ containing those vectors row reduces as follows
$$
A = \left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\mid & \mid  & \mid & \mid & \mid \\
\mathsf{v}_1 & \mathsf{v}_2 & \mathsf{v}_3 &\mathsf{v}_4 &\mathsf{v}_5  \\
\mid & \mid  & \mid & \mid & \mid 
\end{array}
\right]
 \longrightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -3 & 0 & 2  \\
0 & 1 & 4 & 0 &  1  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1  \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
$$


  a.  Do the vectors $\mathsf{v}_1, \mathsf{v}_2, \mathsf{v}_3, \mathsf{v}_4, \mathsf{v}_5$ span $\mathbb{R}^4$? Justify your answer.

  b. Is the vector $\mathsf{v}_3$  in $\mathrm{span}(\mathsf{v}_1,\mathsf{v}_2)$? Justify your answer.

  c. Pick any $\mathsf{b}$ in $\mathrm{span}(\mathsf{v}_1, \mathsf{v}_2, \mathsf{v}_3, \mathsf{v}_4, \mathsf{v}_5)$. Is there always a unique way to write $\mathsf{b}$ as a linear combination of $\mathsf{v}_1, \mathsf{v}_2, \mathsf{v}_3, \mathsf{v}_4, \mathsf{v}_5$? Justify your answer.





<!-- ## Removing free variable columns from a matrix -->

<!-- Consider the matrix -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- A =\left[ -->
<!-- \begin{array}{cccccc} -->
<!--  6 & 5 & -3 & 4 & 2 & -9 \\ -->
<!--  -7 & -6 & 4 & -5 & -7 & 16 \\ -->
<!--  -4 & -3 & -1 & 0 & -8 & 9 \\ -->
<!--  8 & 7 & -5 & 6 & 1 & -12  -->
<!-- \end{array} -->
<!-- \right]. -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!--   a. Use RStudio to show that the columns  of $\mathsf{A}$ span $\mathbb{R}^4$. You don't need to turn in an R file here, just report the reduced row echelon form that you get. -->
<!--   b. Write down the new matrix $\mathsf{A}'$ gotten by removing the free variable columns from $\mathsf{A}$.  -->
<!--   c. Without using additional calculations on RStudio, explain why the new system $\mathsf{A}' \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{b}$ is **consistent**  and has a **unique solution** for every choice of $\mathsf{b} \in  \mathbb{R}^4$. -->



## A square matrix 

Suppose that $A$ is a $5\times 5$ matrix and $\mathsf{b}$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^5$ with the property that 
$A\mathsf{x}=\mathsf{b}$ has a unique solution. Explain why the columns of $A$ must span $\mathbb{R}^5$.  Use the reduced row echelon form of $A$ in your explanation.

## Combining solutions to $A \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{b}$

Suppose that $\mathsf{x}_1$ and $\mathsf{x}_2$ are solutions to $\mathsf{A} \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{b}$ (where $\mathsf{b} \not= \mathsf{0}$). 

a. Decide if any of the following are also solutions to $\mathsf{A} \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{b}$.
    i. $\mathsf{x}_1+ \mathsf{x}_2$
    ii. $\mathsf{x}_1 - \mathsf{x}_2$
    iii. $\frac{1}{2} ( \mathsf{x}_1 + \mathsf{x}_2)$
    iv. $\frac{5}{2} \mathsf{x}_1 - \frac{3}{2} \mathsf{x}_2$.

b. Under what conditions on $c$ and $d$ is $\mathsf{x} = c \mathsf{x}_1 + d \mathsf{x}_2$ a solution to $\mathsf{A} \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{b}$? Justify your answer.
c. Let $\mathsf{u}$ be the vector that *points to* $1/3$ of the way from the tip of $\mathsf{v}$ to the tip of $\mathsf{w}$ as depicted below. 
    i. Write $\mathsf{u}$ as a linear combination of $\mathsf{v}$ and $\mathsf{w}$ (hint: think about $\mathsf{w} - \mathsf{v}$)
    ii. If $\mathsf{v}$ and $\mathsf{w}$ are solutions to $A x = \mathsf{b}$ then show that $\mathsf{u}$ is also a solution to $A \mathsf{x} = \mathsf{b}$.

## A Balanced Diet
  
<!-- https://lvs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/protein-fat-carb-counter.pdf -->

An athlete wants to consume  a daily diet of 200 grams of carbohydrates, 60 grams of fats and 160 grams of  proteins. Here are some of their favorite foods.


```{r}
food.data <- data.frame(
   food = c ("almonds", "avocado",  "beans", "bread", "cheese", "chicken", "egg", "milk", "zucchini"),
   carbs = c(3,15,20,12,1,0,1,12,6),
   fats = c(8,31,1,1,5,13,5,8,0), 
   proteins = c(5,4,8,2,3,50,6,8,2)
)

knitr::kable(
  food.data, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Food Carb/Fat/Protein (grams)'
)
```

Answer the following  questions, using RStudio for your calculations. Each response must use **two or more** of the following terms:  linear combination, span, linearly dependent, linearly independent. 


1. Explain why they **cannot** achieve their daily goal by eating only almonds, milk and zucchini.

2. Explain why they **cannot** achieve their daily goal by eating only almonds, beans and cheese.

3. Find a valid one-day diet consisting of almonds, chicken, and zucchini. 

## Missing Column

The matrices below are supposed to be $3 \times 3$ but in each case the third column was accdentally deleted. In each case, add a third column, that has no 0s in it and is different from either the first or second column, so that the columns of  $A$ are linearly dependent and so that the columns of $B$ are linearly independent. Briefly describe your strategy.
$$
A=\left[
\begin{matrix}
1& 0 & \quad \\
0& 1& \quad \\
2& 2& \quad \\
\end{matrix}\right]  \qquad\qquad  
B=\left[
\begin{matrix}
1& 0 & \quad \\
0& 1& \quad \\
2& 2& \quad \\
\end{matrix}\right] 
$$

## Linear System

Use R to solve this problem. Do your computations in an R markdown file.  Knit the file to HTML and include it with your homework. Here you [can download a template for doing this problem](https://github.com/Tom-Halverson/math236_s21/blob/main/PS-2.9-template.Rmd) (including the matrix typed out for you!).
$$
A =\left[
\begin{array}{cccccc}
 12 & 10 & -6 & 8 & 4 & -18 \\
 -7 & -6 & 4 & -5 & -7 & 16 \\
 9 & 9 & -9 & 9 & 9 & -27 \\
 -4 & -3 & -1 & 0 & -8 & 9 \\
 8 & 7 & -5 & 6 & 1 & -12 \\
\end{array}
\right] \quad
b = \begin{bmatrix} 14 \\ -12 \\ 9\\ -15 \\6 \end{bmatrix}
$$

a. Show that the columns of $A$ are linearly dependent by finding two different dependency relations among them. You can write your answer in a form  like $5 a1+ 4 a2 + 3 a3 + 2 a4 + a5 = 0$, where $a1, a2,$ etc are the columns of $A$. 

b. Augment $A$ with $b$ and show that $A x = b$ is consistent and has infinitely many solutions.

c. Remove the free-variable columns from $A$ to get a new, smaller matrix $A'$. Show that $A' x = b$ has a unique solution and say what that solution is.
