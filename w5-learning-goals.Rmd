# Week 5-6 Learning Goals



Here are the knowledge and skills you should master by the end of the fifth and sixth weeks.


## Eigensystems

I should be able to do the following **tasks**:

* Check whether a given vector $\mathsf{v}$ is an  eigenvector for square matrix $A$.
* Find the eigenvalues of a matrix $2 \times 2$ matrix by hand, using the  characteristic equation
* Find the eigenvalues of a triangular matix by inspection.
* Given the eigenvalues of matrix $A$, find the eigenvectors by solving $(A - \lambda I) = \mathbf{0}$.
* Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an  $n \times n$ matrix $A$ using `eigen(A)` on RStudio.
* Determine whether a matrix is diagonalizable.
* Factor a diagonalizable $n \times n$ matrix as $A = PDP^{-1}$ where $D$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and $P$ is the matrix whose columns are the corresponding eignvectors.
* Compute matrix powers using the diagonalization.
* Use RStudio to find complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.

* Factor a $2 \times 2$ scaling-rotation matrix as $A = P C P^{-1}$ where $C$ is a  scaling-rotation matrix $\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \end{bmatrix}$  and $P = [ \mathsf{w}, \mathsf{u}]$ where $\mathsf{v} = \mathsf{u} + i \mathsf{w}$ is the eigenvector for $\lambda = a + b i$.

* Find the angle of rotation and the scaling factor in a $2 \times 2$ matrix with complex eigenvalues.

* Use the dominant eigenvalue and dominant eigenvector to determine the long-term behavior of a dynamical system.

* Use eigenvalues to investigate a population modeled with a Leslie matrix.

* Give a close-formula for a dynamical system using the eigen decomposition of a matrix

## Vocabulary

I should know and be able to use and explain the following **terms** or **properties**. 

* eigenvalue, eigenvector  and eigenspace
* characteristic equation
* diagonalizable matrix
* similar matrices
* algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue
* geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue
* scaling-rotation matrix
* discrete dynamical system
* trajectory
* dominant eigenvalue  and dominant eigenvector
* population model
* Leslie matrix

## Conceptual Thinking

I should understand and be able to explain the following **concepts**:

* An eigenspace of $A$ is a subspace that is fixed under the linear transformation $T(\mathsf{x}) = A \mathsf{x}$.
* An eigenvalue $\lambda$ with $1 <| \lambda |$ corresponds to expansion.
* An eigenvalue $\lambda$ with $0 < | \lambda | < 1$ corresponds to contraction.
* A complex  eigenvalue  corresponds  to a rotation in a 2D subspace.
* The eigenspace for $\lambda$ is the subspace $E_\lambda = \mathrm{Nul}(A  - \lambda I)$.
* A matrix is  not diagonalizable when it has complex eigenvalues.
* A matrix is not diagonalizable when it has an eigenvalue whose algebraic mutiplicity is strictly larger than its geometrix multiplicity.

* The long-term behavior of a  dynamical system is determined by its dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector.
* Population model predicts one of: long term growth, extinction, convergence to a stable population.
