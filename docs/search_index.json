For full credit, please solve these by hand, doing all row reductions that bring the system of equations to Reduced Row Echelon Form. On future assignments, you can solve problems like this using either RStudio or WolframAlpha. You are welcome (and, in fact, encouraged) to check your answers using software. \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(2,4)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the three points: \\((1,3), (3,11),(3,10)\\). \\(f(x)\\) passes through the two points: \\((1,3)\\) and \\((3,11)\\). 1.5 Traffic Flow Below you find a section of one-way streets in downtown St Paul, where the arrows indicate traffic direction. The traffic control center has installed electronic sensors that count the numbers of vehicles passing through the 6 streets that lead into and out of this area. Assume that the total flow that enters each intersection equals the the total flow that leaves each intersection (we will ignore parking and staying). Create a system of linear equations to find the possible flow values for the inner streets \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\). Using RStudio, enter the augmented matrix of this system, and solve it using the rref command. Type out the general solution to this system of equations. Your answer to part b should be an infinite solution set. Give two distinct solutions that are realistic in terms of traffic flow. Is it possible to close down the street labeled by \\(x_2\\) for road construction? That is, is it possible to have \\(x_2 = 0\\) and to meet the other conditions?

This problem illustrates what happens if you try to make the matrix of a transformation that is not linear. Consider the transformation \\(T\\) defined by \\[ T \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + x_2^2 + x_3 \\\\ 2 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + 1 \\\\ 2 x_1 + 3 x_2 + x_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] a. Show that this is not a linear transformation by demonstrating, with a specific example, that one of the rules of being linear is not true. Now. let’s see what happens if we compute its matrix anyway. Compute \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_1)\\), \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_2)\\), and \\(T(\\mathbf{e}_3)\\), and put the vectors you get in the columns of a matrix \\(A\\). Then compute the product below: \\[ \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}}_{A} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_ 2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\] Explain how the result of this computation demonstrates that \\(T\\) is not linear. 3.5 A Proof Let \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) be a linear transformation. Suppose that \\(\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}\\) is a linearly independent set of vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) but the set of images \\(\\{T(v_1), T(v_2), T(v_3), T(v_4)\\}\\) is a linearly dependent set in \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\). In the following steps, you will prove that \\(T\\) is not one-to-one. Write out clearly, using the definition, what it means for \\(\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}\\) to be linearly independent. Write out clearly, using the definition, what it means for \\(\\{T(v_1), T(v_2), T(v_3), T(v_4)\\}\\) to be linearly dependent. Use the definition of linear transformation and parts (a) and (b) above to argue that \\(T(x) = \\vec{0}\\) for some nonzero vector \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Explain why this tells us that \\(T\\) is not one-to-one. 3.6 Inner and Outer Products We can also think of vectors as matrix. A column vector is an \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix and a row vector is a \\(1 \\times n\\) matrix. Compute the following products. These matrix products are called inner products (or dot products) of the vectors. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\1 \\\\1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] b. Now compute the following products. These are called outer products. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -5 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\end{bmatrix} = \\hskip3in \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\1 \\\\3 \\\\\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\end{bmatrix} =\\hskip3in \\] Row reduce both of the matrices that you get in part b (this should be easy to do by hand,but you can use R if you want to). How many pivots do you get? Explain why you always get this number of pivots when you row reduce an outer product. 3.7 Archaeological Seriation The matrix \\(A\\) below is used in archaeological dating. Its rows correspond to four different grave sites \\(G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4\\) and its columns correspond to five types of pottery\\(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5\\).

Give the meaning of the \\(i\\)-\\(j\\) entry of \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) (the entry in row \\(i\\) and column \\(j\\)). State clearly the meaning of this entry using complete sentences (or sentence) and explain why it has this meaning. 3.8 Rental Car Solve this problem using R and turn in a markdown file knitted to .html. A group of Macalester alumni open a rental car company specializing in renting electric cars. As a start, they have opened offices in St. Paul, Rochester, and Duluth. Through market research they find that of the cars rented in St. Paul, 85% will get returned in St. Paul, 9% will get returned in Rochester, and 6% will get returned in Duluth. Of the cars rented in Rochester, 30% will get returned in St. Paul, 60% will get returned in Rochester, and 10% in Duluth. Of the cars rented in Duluth, 35% will get returned in St. Paul, 5% in Rochester, and 60% in Duluth. This information is represented in the matrix below. StP = c(.85,.09,.06) Roch = c(.30,.60,.10) Dul = c(.35,.05,.60) M = cbind(StP,Roch,Dul) M ## StP Roch Dul ## [1,] 0.85 0.3 0.35 ## [2,] 0.09 0.6 0.05 ## [3,] 0.06 0.1 0.60 Such a matrix is called a probability matrix or a stochastic matrix because it contains numbers between 0 and 1 and each of its columns sum to 1. The owners are trying to use this data to estimate how much of their fleet will be at each location on average in the long run. Assume that initially they locate 20 cars in each city. This can be recorded by the vector v0 = c(20,20,20). Apply, M to v0, call this vector v1, and explain, using how the matrix-vector product works, why v1 represents the number of cars at each location one day later (for simplicity, we assume that each rental is for 1 day). Now apply M to v1 and call it v2. This should represent the number of cars at each location 2 days later. Also compute the square of the matrix M and call it M2. Confirm that M2 times v0 is the same as M times v1. Write a for loop that applies M over and over again to see what happens to the distribution of cars in the long-run (we will learn how to do this in class but you can also probably just google it). Does this sequence stabilize or does it keep changing after each application? If it does stabilize, how long does it take to stabilize (to within 0.1 cars at each location). Does the starting distribution matter? Try 4 different starting distributions (with a total of 60 cars) and see what the final distribution looks like in each case. For one of your 4 starting distributions, try all 60 cars at one of the locations.

This is modeled in the rain-sunshine probability matrix P. \\[ P = \\begin{array}{c|cc|} &amp;\\text{rain}&amp;\\text{sun}\\\\ \\hline \\text{rain}&amp;1/2&amp;1/10\\\\ \\text{sun}&amp;1/2&amp;9/10\\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] This matrix works as follows: if the rain-sunshine probability today is (40, 60) (that is, 40% chance rain and 60% chance sunshine), then the rain-sunshine probability tomorrow is (26, 74) as seen by the calculation below. \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 &amp; 1/10 \\\\ 1/2 &amp; 9/10 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 40 \\\\ 60 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 26 \\\\ 74 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Find the rain-sunshine probability the day after tomorrow. Compute \\(P^2\\) and explain the meaning of each of the four entries in the matrix. Find \\(P^{-1}\\) and and use it find the rain-sunshine probability yesterday if the rain-sunshine probability today is (40, 60). 4.2 Fibonacci Vectors The Fibonacci vectors \\(F\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) are defined below: \\[ F = \\left\\{ \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{bmatrix} ~\\Bigg\\vert~ \\ x_3 = x_1 + x_2, x_4 = x_2 + x_3, x_5 = x_3 + x_4 \\right\\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^5. \\hskip5in \\] Show that \\(F\\) is a subspace.

For each of the following statements, either give a specific example or explain why it cannot happen. If \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is not in \\(S\\) and \\(c\\) is a nonzero constant, can \\(c\\mathsf{v}\\) be in \\(S\\)? If \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is not in \\(S\\) and \\(\\mathsf{w}\\) is not in \\(S\\), can \\(\\mathsf{v} + \\mathsf{w}\\) be in \\(S\\)? If \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is in \\(S\\) and \\(\\mathsf{w}\\) is not in \\(S\\) can \\(\\mathsf{v} + \\mathsf{w}\\) be in \\(S\\)? 4.7 A Vector in Both Col(A) and Nul(A) Give a \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix \\(A\\) for which the vector \\(\\mathsf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}3 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix}\\) is in both \\(\\mathrm{Col}(A)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\). Be sure to demonstrate that \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in \\mathrm{Col}(A)\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in \\mathrm{Nul}(A)\\). 4.8 Adjacency Matrix You can do this problem in R or by hand. Consider the matrix \\(A\\) defined here A = rbind(c( 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 ,0), c(1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0, 0 ),c( 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1, 0 ), c( 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1, 0 ),c( 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0, 1 ), c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 0 1 0 1 1 0 ## [2,] 1 0 1 1 0 0 ## [3,] 0 1 0 1 1 0 ## [4,] 1 1 1 0 1 0 ## [5,] 1 0 1 1 0 1 ## [6,] 0 0 0 0 1 0 This matrix represents the connections in the network diagram below. There is a 1 in position \\((i,j)\\) of the matrix if there is a connection (an edge) between vertex \\(i\\) and vertex \\(j\\) and there is a 0 if there is not. Compute \\(A v\\) where \\(v\\) is the vector of all 1’s. Explain what this new vector tells us about the graph. Compute \\(A^2 = A A\\), the square of the matrix \\(A\\). Look at the \\((2,5)\\) entry of \\(A^2\\). Explain what this entry says about connections in the network. Do the same for the \\((2,3)\\) and the \\((2,6)\\) entry of \\(A^2\\). "],["important-definitions.html", "Section 5 Important Definitions 5.1 Vector Spaces 5.2 Matrices 5.3 Orthogonality 5.4 Spectral Decompostion", " Section 5 Important Definitions 5.1 Vector Spaces span A set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) span a vector space \\(V\\) if for every \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in V\\) there exist a set of scalars (weights) \\(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\[ \\mathsf{v} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n. \\] Connection to Matrices: If \\(A = [\\mathsf{v}_1 \\mathsf{v}_2 \\cdots \\mathsf{v}_n]\\) is the matrix with these vectors in the columns, then this is the same as saying that \\(\\mathsf{x} = [c_1, \\ldots, c_n]^{\\top}\\) is a solution to \\(A x = \\mathsf{v}\\). linear independence A set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2,\\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) are linearly independent if the only way to write \\[ \\mathsf{0} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n \\] is with \\(c_1 = c_2 = \\cdots = c_n = 0\\). Connection to Matrices: If \\(A = [\\mathsf{v}_1 \\mathsf{v}_2 \\cdots \\mathsf{v}_n]\\) is the matrix with these vectors in the columns, then this is the same as saying that \\(A x = \\mathsf{0}\\) has only the trivial solution. linear dependence Conversely, a set of vectors \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) are linearly dependent if there exist scalars \\(c_1, c_2,\\ldots, c_n \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) that are not all equal to 0 such that \\[ \\mathsf{0} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n \\] This is called a dependence relation among the vectors. Connection to Matrices: If \\(A = [\\mathsf{v}_1 \\mathsf{v}_2 \\cdots \\mathsf{v}_n]\\) is the matrix with these vectors in the columns, then this is the same as saying that \\(\\mathsf{x} = [c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n]^{\\top}\\) is a nontrivial solution to \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathsf{0}\\). linear transformation A function \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a linear transformation when: \\(T(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{v}) = T(\\mathsf{u}) + T(\\mathsf{v})\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u}, \\mathsf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) (preserves addition) \\(T(c \\mathsf{u} ) = c T(\\mathsf{u})\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) (preserves scalar multiplication). It follows from these that also \\(T(\\mathsf{0}) = \\mathsf{0}\\). one-to-one A function \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a one-to-one when: for all \\(\\mathsf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) there is at most one \\(\\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = \\mathsf{y}\\). onto A function \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\) is a onto when: for all \\(\\mathsf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) there is at least one \\(\\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = \\mathsf{y}\\). subspace A subset \\(S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a subspace when: \\(\\mathsf{u} + \\mathsf{v} \\in S\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u}, \\mathsf{v} \\in S\\) (closed under addition) \\(c \\mathsf{u} \\in S\\) for all \\(\\mathsf{u}\\in S\\) and \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) (closed under scalar multiplication) It follows from these that also \\(\\mathsf{0} \\in S\\). basis A basis of a vector space (or subspace) \\(V\\) is a set of vectors \\(\\mathcal{B} = \\{\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\}\\) in \\(V\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) span \\(V\\) \\(\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\) are linearly independent Equivalently, one can say that \\(\\mathcal{B} = \\{\\mathsf{v}_1, \\mathsf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{v}_n\\}\\) is a basis of \\(V\\) if for every vector \\(\\mathsf{v} \\in V\\) there is a unique set of scalars \\(c_1, \\ldots, c_n\\) such that \\[ \\mathsf{v} = c_1 \\mathsf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathsf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathsf{v}_n. \\] (The fact that there is a set of vectors comes from the span; the fact that they are unique comes from linear independence). dimension The dimension of a subspace \\(W\\) is the number of vectors in any basis of \\(W\\). This is also the fewest number of vectors required to span the subspace. 5.2 Matrices invertible The square \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is invertible when there exists an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A^{-1}\\) such that \\(A A^{-1} = I = A^{-1} A\\). The Invertible Matrix Theorem collects over two dozen equivalent conditions, each of which guarantees that \\(A\\) is invertible. null space The null space \\(\\mbox{Nul}(A) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) of the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is the set of solutions to the homogeneous equation \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathbf{0}\\)&gt; We also write this as \\[ \\mbox{Nul}(A) = \\{ \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : A \\mathsf{x} = \\mathbf{0} \\} \\] Connection to Linear Transformations: If \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = A \\mathsf{x}\\), then the kernel of \\(T\\) is the null space of matrix \\(A\\). column space The column space \\(\\mbox{Col}(A) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m\\) of the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of \\(A\\). For \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathsf{a}_1 &amp; \\mathsf{a}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathsf{a}_n \\end{bmatrix}\\), we have \\[ \\mbox{Col}(A) = \\mbox{span} ( \\mathsf{a}_1, \\mathsf{a}_2, \\ldots , \\mathsf{a}_n ) \\] We also write this as \\[ \\mbox{Col}(A) = \\{ \\mathsf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m : \\mathsf{b} = A \\mathsf{x} \\mbox{ for some } \\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\}. \\] Connection to Linear Transformations: If \\(T(\\mathsf{x}) = A \\mathsf{x}\\), then the range (also called the image) of \\(T\\) is the column space of matrix \\(A\\). rank The rank of the \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) is the dimension of the column space of \\(A\\). This is also the number of pivot columns of the matrix. eigenvalue and eigenvector For a square \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), the scalar \\(\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is an eigenvalue for \\(A\\) when there exists a nonzero vector \\(\\mathsf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that \\(A \\mathsf{x} = \\lambda \\mathsf{x}\\). The nonzero vector \\(\\mathsf{x}\\) is the eigenvector for eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\). The collection of all of these eigenvalues and eigenvectors is called the eigensystem of A. diagonalization A square \\(n \\times n\\) matrix is diagonalizable when \\(A = P D P^{-1}\\) where \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix and \\(P\\) is an invertible matrix. In this case, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are the diagonal entries of \\(D\\) and their corresponding eigenvectors are the columns of \\(P\\). dominant eigenvalue The eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) of the square matrix \\(A\\) is the dominant eigenvalue when \\(| \\lambda | &gt; | \\mu |\\) where \\(\\mu\\) is any other eigenvalue of \\(A\\). The dominant eigenvalue determines the long-term behavior of \\(A^t\\) as \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\). 5.3 Orthogonality length The length of a vector \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is \\[ \\| \\mathsf{v} \\| = \\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \\cdots + v_n^2}. \\] distance and angle The distance between vectors \\(\\mathsf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) is \\[ \\mbox{dist}(\\mathsf{u},\\mathsf{v}) = \\| \\mathsf{u} - \\mathsf{v} \\|. \\] The angle \\(\\theta\\) between these vectors is determined by \\[ \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\mathsf{u} \\cdot \\mathsf{v}}{ \\| \\mathsf{u} \\| \\, \\| \\mathsf{v} \\|}. \\] orthogonal The vectors \\(\\mathsf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{v}\\) are orthogonal when \\(\\mathsf{u} \\cdot \\mathsf{v} = 0\\). This means that either one of them is the zero vector, or they are perpendicular to one another. orthogonal complement If \\(W \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a subspace, then its orthogonal complement \\(W^{\\perp}\\) is the set of all vectors in \\(\\mathsf{R}^n\\) that are orthogonal to \\(W\\). We also write \\[ W^{\\perp} = \\{ \\mathsf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\mathsf{v} \\cdot \\mathsf{w} \\mbox{ for all } \\mathsf{w} \\in W \\}. \\] orthonormal set A collection of vectors \\(\\mathsf{u}_1, \\mathsf{u}_2, \\ldots, \\mathsf{u}_k\\) are an orthonormal set when every vector has length 1 and the vectors are pairwise orthogonal. orthogonal matrix orthogonal matrix A square \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(P\\) is an orthogonal matrix when its columns are an orthonormal set. As a result, we have \\(P^{-1} = P^{\\top}\\). projection and residual The orthogonal projection of vector \\(\\mathsf{y}\\) into a subspace \\(W\\) is the unique vector \\(\\hat{\\mathsf{y}} \\in W\\) such that \\(\\mathsf{z} = \\mathsf{y} - \\hat{\\mathsf{y}} \\in W^{\\perp}\\). The vector \\(\\mathsf{z}\\) is called the residual vector for the projection. 5.4 Spectral Decompostion orthogonal diagonalization Every symmetric \\(n \\times n\\) matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable, meaning that we have \\(A = P D P^{\\top}\\) where \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix and \\(P\\) is an orthogonal matrix. The diagonal entries of \\(D\\) are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) and the columns of \\(P\\) are the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors. Furthermore, the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are nonnegative. spectral decomposition A symmetric matrix \\(A\\) can be written as a linear combination of rank 1 matrices derived from the orthonormal eigensystem of \\(A\\). In particular, we have \\[ A = \\lambda_1 \\mathsf{u}_1 \\mathsf{u}_1^{\\top} + \\lambda_2 \\mathsf{u}_2 \\mathsf{u}_2^{\\top} + \\cdots + \\lambda_n \\mathsf{u}_n \\mathsf{u}_n^{\\top}. \\] This linear combination of rank 1 vectors is called the spectral decomposition of \\(A\\). singular value decomposition (SVD) Any \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) of rank \\(r\\) can be factored into its singular value decomposition \\(U \\Sigma V^{\\top}\\) where \\(U\\) is an \\(m \\times m\\) orthogonal matrix, \\(\\Sigma\\) is a matrix whose nonzero entries are the positive numbers \\(\\sigma_1, \\ldots , \\sigma_r\\), which appear in decreasing order on the diagonal, and \\(V\\) is an \\(n \\times n\\) orthogonal matrix. The nonzero entries of \\(\\Sigma\\) are called the singular values of \\(A\\). The columns of \\(U\\) are the left singular vectors and the rows of \\(V^{\\top}\\) are the right singular vectors. SVD spectral decomposition Any \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) of rank \\(r\\) can be written as a linear combination of rank 1 matrices derived from the singular value decomposition of \\(A\\). In particular, we have \\[ A = \\sigma_1 \\mathsf{u}_1 \\mathsf{v}_1^{\\top} + \\sigma_2 \\mathsf{u}_2 \\mathsf{v}_2^{\\top} + \\cdots + \\sigma_r \\mathsf{u}_r \\mathsf{v}_r^{\\top}. \\] This linear combination of rank 1 vectors is called the (SVD) spectral decomposition of \\(A\\).

This is the easiest way to use RStudio and works great for our course. You can also download the free desktop version of RStudio. If you plan to go on to take more MSCS classes, especially in statistics and data science, you may want to use the desktop version. Download the desktop version following the instructions here: rstudio.com/products. Now, let’s learn how to use R to solve systems of linear equations! Download this Rmd file. First, we will create vectors and matrices Then we will see how to create an augmented matrix and then apply Gaussian Elimination to obtain is reduced row echelon form. Gaussian elimination is performed by the rref() command. However, this command is not loaded into R by default. So we have have to tell RStudio to use the practical math package, which is known as pracma. So we need to run the following command once at the beginning of our session. require(pracma) 10.2 Building Vectors and Matrices A vector in R is a list of data. The simplest way to create a vector is to use the c() command. The letter ‘c’ is short for ‘combine these values into a vector.’ For example, we can make a vector v for the numbers 1,2,3 as follows: v=c(1,2,3) v ## [1] 1 2 3 Note that we had to ask R to display the value of v. This is because the assignment of v doesn’t echo the value to the console. But can see the value of v in the Environment tab in the upper right panel of RStudio. For example, run this command and then check to see that the value of v gets updated in the environment. v=c(1,2,3,4,5,6) It is interesting to note that c() returns a dimensionless vector. So you can treat a vector c() as either a row or a column when you construct a matrix. For example, suppose that we want to make the matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] We could create this matrix by binding three row vectors: A = rbind(c(1,1,1), c(2,4,8), c(3,9,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 or we could bind three column vectors: A = cbind(c(1,2,3), c(1,4,9), c(1,8,27)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 10.3 Solving a Linear System Suppose that we want to solve the linear system \\[\\begin{aligned} x + y + z &amp;= 7 \\\\ 2x + 4y + 8z &amp;= 6 \\\\ 3x +9y+27z &amp;=12 \\end{aligned}\\] which has coefficient matrix \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\\\ 3 &amp; 9 &amp; 27 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] and target (column) vector \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix}. \\] This is the same matrix A we defined above. Let’s define a vector b and use cbind() to create an augmented matrix which we will name Ab. (We could have just made the full augmented matrix from the start, but using cbind to add a column to a matrix is a skill we will use later in the course!) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 4 8 ## [3,] 3 9 27 b = c(4,6,12) Ab = cbind(A,b) Ab ## b ## [1,] 1 1 1 4 ## [2,] 2 4 8 6 ## [3,] 3 9 27 12 Now we use the rref() command to apply Gaussian Elimination to produce the reduced row echelon form. (And remember: we had to load this function into R by using the require(pracma) command above.) rref(Ab) ## b ## [1,] 1 0 0 7 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -4 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 We conclude that this is a consistent system no free variables. The unique solution is \\[\\begin{align} x&amp;=7\\\\ y&amp;=-4\\\\ z&amp;=1 \\end{align}\\] We can verify that our answer works by multiplying \\(A\\) by one of the solutions above. Matrix multiplication uses the funny operation %*%. A %*% c(7,-4,1) ## [,1] ## [1,] 4 ## [2,] 6 ## [3,] 12 #A %*% c(1,2,3,0,0) Which matches our target \\[ b = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 12 \\end{bmatrix} \\] just as we had hoped. 10.4 Solving another Linear System Now let’s find the solution set for the linear system \\[ \\begin{array}{rrrrrcr} x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ 2x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +2x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; 4 \\\\ -x_1 &amp; +x_2 &amp; +x_3 &amp; &amp; &amp; = &amp; 10 \\\\ x_1 &amp; &amp; -x_3 &amp; -x_4 &amp; -x_5 &amp; = &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] which corresponds to augmented matrix \\[ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rrrrr|r} 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 2 &amp; +1 &amp; +2 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; 4 \\\\ -1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1 &amp; &amp; &amp; 10 \\\\ 1 &amp; &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 &amp; -2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right] \\] This time, let’s just construct the augmented matrix direclty. Then we define the coefficient matrix \\(A\\). Here we use cbind to combine the vectors into the columns of a matrix named \\(A\\). You can use rbind if you want to combine the vectors into the rows of a matrix. Ab = cbind(c(1,2,-1,1),c(0,1,1,0),c(-1,2,1,-1),c(-1,1,0,-1),c(-1,5,0,-1),c(-2,10,4,-2)) Ab ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 ## [2,] 2 1 2 1 5 10 ## [3,] -1 1 1 0 0 4 ## [4,] 1 0 -1 -1 -1 -2 And now let’s row reduce to get RREF. rref(Ab) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 1 1 ## [2,] 0 1 0 -1 -1 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 1 2 3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 So the set of solutions in parametric form is \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\\\ x_5 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + s \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + t \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] and this is a “plane” in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). It is in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\) because these vectors have 5 coordinates. It is a plane because it is spanned by two vectors that are not on the same line. 10.5 Appendix: Dimensionless Vectors in R Let’s revisit the vector constructed by cbind. Above we called this a “dimensionless” vector because it can be used as a column vector or a row vector. In general, R will do its best to make sense of a dimensionless vector. In other words, it will promote c() to make an expression valid. For example, let \\(A\\) be an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix, and let \\(b\\) be a vector. The expression \\(Av\\) is only defined when \\(v\\) is a \\(n \\times 1\\) column vector and that \\(wA\\) is only defined when \\(w\\) is a \\(1 \\times n\\) ** row vector**. But let’s look at what happens when we use a dimensionless vector instead. A = cbind(c(1,1,1),c(-1,0,1), c(0,1,-1)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 -1 0 ## [2,] 1 0 1 ## [3,] 1 1 -1 b = c(2,5,11) b ## [1] 2 5 11 # A times b A %*% b ## [,1] ## [1,] -3 ## [2,] 13 ## [3,] -4 # b times A b %*% A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 18 9 -6 Both of these multiplications worked! So R treated b as a column vector for the multiplicationA %*% b. And then R treated b as a row vector for the multiplication b %b% A. So how do you make a true column vector or a true row vector? The answer is to use cbind and rbind! Here are some examples: # dimensionless b = c(1,2,3,4) b ## [1] 1 2 3 4 # column vector b.col = cbind(b) b.col ## b ## [1,] 1 ## [2,] 2 ## [3,] 3 ## [4,] 4 # row vector b.row = rbind(b) b.row ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## b 1 2 3 4 "],["linear-dependence.html", "Section 11 Linear Dependence 11.1 Example 1: a 7x9 integer matrix 11.2 A 5 x 6 Numerical Matrix 11.3 Random Matrices", " Section 11 Linear Dependence In this activity, we will explore linear dependence and independence in the context of solving nonhomogeneous \\(A x = b\\) and homogeneous equations \\(A x = 0\\).

You can see that in rref(A). rref(A) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 -2 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 -2 0 0 0 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 -3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 -2 0 0 0 3 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ## [6,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 ## [7,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Discuss in your group how you see it. Then write out a dependence relation among the columns by filling in numbers for the weights in this equation \\[ 0 = c_1 \\vec{a}_1 + c_2 \\vec{a}_2 + c_3 \\vec{a}_3 + c_4 \\vec{a}_4 + c_5 \\vec{a}_5 + c_6 \\vec{a}_6 + c_7 \\vec{a}_7 + c_8 \\vec{a}_8 + c_9 \\vec{a}_9. \\] Challenge: give a dependency relation that none of the other groups in the class have. This is telling us that there is some redundancy in the matrix A. Remove columns from A to get a new matrix M whose columns are linearly independent. You can do this by removing the appropriate columns from the code below: M = cbind( # you need to edit this matrix c(3, 0, 0, 1, -2, -4, 1), c(5, -5, 0, 3, 3, 1, 4), c(3, 5, -1, 1, -3, -3, 5), c(4, -1, -2, 0, -1, 2, -3), c(0, 17, 3, 0, -17, -29, 8), c(-4, -1, -5, -2, -1, -4, 3), c(5, 3, -4, -5, -2, -3, -1), c(0, 5, -3, -2, -1, -5, 0), c(37, -10, -27, -29, 4, 7, -24) ) M ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] ## [1,] 3 5 3 4 0 -4 5 0 37 ## [2,] 0 -5 5 -1 17 -1 3 5 -10 ## [3,] 0 0 -1 -2 3 -5 -4 -3 -27 ## [4,] 1 3 1 0 0 -2 -5 -2 -29 ## [5,] -2 3 -3 -1 -17 -1 -2 -1 4 ## [6,] -4 1 -3 2 -29 -4 -3 -5 7 ## [7,] 1 4 5 -3 8 3 -1 0 -24 rref(M) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 -2 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 -2 0 0 0 2 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 -3 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 -2 0 0 0 3 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ## [6,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 6 ## [7,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Your matrix should now be square (7x7) with linearly independent columns. R has a build in solve command, solve, that works for matrices of this form (i.e., square with linearly independent columns). You can try it here. First you need to un-comment-out the solve command. I have it commented out right now, because it does not work with the matrix M (above) until you remove its redundancies. # solve(M,b) Now, you should get a unique solution to the equation M x = b, since M has no free variables, and it should be one of the solutions to the original question A x = b. Which solution is it? That is, which of the many solutions to A x = b are you getting here (forw which values of the paramters?). Compare this with trying to use solve on the original equation A x = b with linearly dependent columns. The solve command in the next bit of code is commented out. Delete the comment command and try executing it. # solve(A,b) 11.2 A 5 x 6 Numerical Matrix So far, all of the matrices we’ve worked with in this class have integer values. This is only so that the calulations are nice to do by hand. All of our theory works over the real numbers. Here we will look at a real matrix with numerical values, something you might find when dealing with real-world data. B = cbind( c(0.717, -0.274, 0.365, 0.482, -0.362), c(0.587, -0.545, 0.5, -0.407, -0.597), c(-0.441, 0.886, 0.784, -0.831, -0.594), c(0.923, -0.466, 0.222, 0.867, 0.493), c(-0.42, -0.745, -0.02, -0.44, 0.209), c(0.621, 0.049, -0.134, -0.844, -0.31) ) B ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] ## [1,] 0.717 0.587 -0.441 0.923 -0.420 0.621 ## [2,] -0.274 -0.545 0.886 -0.466 -0.745 0.049 ## [3,] 0.365 0.500 0.784 0.222 -0.020 -0.134 ## [4,] 0.482 -0.407 -0.831 0.867 -0.440 -0.844 ## [5,] -0.362 -0.597 -0.594 0.493 0.209 -0.310 and here is a vector d in \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\). d = c(5.886, -4.001, 3.701, -6.621, -2.199) d ## [1] 5.886 -4.001 3.701 -6.621 -2.199 Try answering some of these questions: Are the columns of B linearly independent? Do the columns of B span \\(\\mathbb{R}^5\\)? Give the parametric solution to B x = d. What is the geometric form of this solution (e.g., a plane in \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\))? Remove redundancies from the columns of B to get a new matrix B2 and use solve to solve the equation B2 x = d. Which of the parametric solutions to you get. 11.3 Random Matrices The following code generates a random 5 x 5 matrix. Every time you enter it, it will give you a new matrix.

(A = cbind(c(1,2,3),c(4,5,6),c(1,1,-1))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 1 ## [2,] 2 5 1 ## [3,] 3 6 -1 (B = cbind(c(1,-1,1),c(1,1,1),c(0,2,1))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 0 ## [2,] -1 1 2 ## [3,] 1 1 1 (C = cbind(c(2,1,1),c(1,0,1),c(1,-3,1),c(3,2,1))) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 2 1 1 3 ## [2,] 1 0 -3 2 ## [3,] 1 1 1 1 Multiply these matrices to get \\(AB\\) using the %*% command. As seen here: A %*% B ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -2 6 9 ## [2,] -2 8 11 ## [3,] -4 8 11 Note that \\(BA\\) is not the same as \\(AB\\). B %*% A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 3 9 2 ## [2,] 7 13 -2 ## [3,] 6 15 1 That is, matrix multiplication is not commutative. It can be the case that \\(AB\\) equals \\(BA\\) but most if the time these are not equal. We can multiply \\(BC\\) to get B %*% C ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 3 1 -2 5 ## [2,] 1 1 -2 1 ## [3,] 4 2 -1 6 But \\(CB\\) does not make sense, since \\(C\\) is 3 x 4 and \\(B\\) is 3 x 3. The inner dimensions to not match. R tells us that the matrices are non-conformable. C %*% B ## Error in C %*% B: non-conformable arguments 12.2 Transpose The transpose of a matrix is computed by t(A). For example t(A) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 2 3 ## [2,] 4 5 6 ## [3,] 1 1 -1 t(B) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 -1 1 ## [2,] 1 1 1 ## [3,] 0 2 1 Note that the transpose is order reversing. That is \\[ (AB)^T = B^T A^T. \\] We can see that here ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -2 -2 -4 ## [2,] 6 8 8 ## [3,] 9 11 11 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -2 -2 -4 ## [2,] 6 8 8 ## [3,] 9 11 11 12.3 Identity Matrix The command diag(n) gives the n x n identity matrix. This is denoted \\(I_n\\). For example, below are \\(I_3\\), \\(I_4\\), and \\(I_5.\\) diag(3) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 diag(4) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 diag(5) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 0 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 0 0 ## [4,] 0 0 0 1 0 ## [5,] 0 0 0 0 1 The identity matrix has the same effect as multiplyng by 1. For example, diag(3) %*% A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 1 ## [2,] 2 5 1 ## [3,] 3 6 -1 A %*% diag(3) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 4 1 ## [2,] 2 5 1 ## [3,] 3 6 -1 12.4 Writing Loops Work on problem 3.8 in the homework. In this problem, you will write out a loop in R to apply a matrix over and over again. Here is an example for you to use to compare with. First, define a vector \\(v\\) and a matrix \\(A\\) and multiply \\(Av\\). v = c(10,90) A = cbind(c(.9,.1),c(.5,.5)) A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 54 ## [2,] 46 If we want to appy \\(A\\) to \\(v\\) again and again, we can keep multiplying by \\(A\\): A %*% A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 71.6 ## [2,] 28.4 A %*% A %*% A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 78.64 ## [2,] 21.36 A %*% A %*% A %*% A %*% v ## [,1] ## [1,] 81.456 ## [2,] 18.544 It is better to write a loop to do something like this. The following loop will multiply by A 10 times. Try changing the 10 to 4 (and compare with above). Try changing the 10 to 100. N = 10 # the number of times that we will multiply by A w = c(10,90) # the starting value for (i in 1:N) { # loop as the index i goes from 1 to N w = A %*% w # multiply Aw and replace w with this new vector } w # show the final value of w ## [,1] ## [1,] 83.32564 ## [2,] 16.67436 12.5 Matrix Inverses Give a square matrix ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 10 -6 1 ## [2,] -2 1 0 ## [3,] -7 5 -1 You find its inverse using solve: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 1 1 ## [2,] 2 3 2 ## [3,] 3 8 2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 0 ## [2,] 1.776357e-15 1.000000e+00 0 ## [3,] 3.552714e-15 1.776357e-15 1 Note that if you look closely at the last matrix, it is within round off error of the identity. For example, the number 1.776357 e-15 is 0.000000000000001776357. To make it look more like the identity, you can use the command zapsmall, which converts very small numbers like this to 0. ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 0 0 ## [2,] 0 1 0 ## [3,] 0 0 1 What happens if you try to invert a matrix that is not invertible. For example in the following matrix, the third column is the sum of the first two, so the columns are linearly dependent. If we try to inverti it A = cbind(c(10,-2,-7),c(-6,1,5),c(4,-1,-2)) A ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 10 -6 4 ## [2,] -2 1 -1 ## [3,] -7 5 -2 solve(A) ## Error in solve.default(A): system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 5.84328e-18 We get the error that the matrix is singular. This is another term for non-invertible.

We give a series of examples of 2D linear transformations. After each example, it’s your turn to play with variations from the same family of transformations. 13.1 Rotations Suppose that we wish to rotate my house by pi/3 radians. As we’ve seen, a 2D rotation matrix by \\(t\\) radians, counter-clockwise, is given by \\[A=\\displaystyle{ \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(t) &amp; -\\sin(t) \\\\ \\sin(t) &amp; \\cos(t) \\end{bmatrix}}.\\] Here is the code to display this transformation.

How can you rotate it clockwise? 13.2 Expansion and contraction Next, we scale the house by 2 in the \\(x\\)-direction and by 3 in the \\(y\\)-direction. # define the matrix A.
